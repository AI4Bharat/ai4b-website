1. Add the timeline and content for areas/\<your-area\>/index.html pages
2. Add all the publications with appropriate "data-conference", "data-year", "data-area" and "badge" values
3. Test for responsiveness and if needed use Bootstrap
4. Fix the responsive issue in the "Pioneering data collection" section which results in the middle image becoming very small on laptops
4. Split the monolithic "ai4b-styles.css" into smaller parts" "ai4b-header.css", "ai4b-footer.css", "ai4b-timelibe.css", etc. Till then for debugging one can grep for the string "Begin" in the css file. 
5. Should create sub-folders under html folder: areas/asr, areas/tts and so on.
